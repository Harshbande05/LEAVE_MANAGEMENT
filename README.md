# 📌 Leave Management System 

## 📖 Introduction

The **Leave Management System** is a Python Django-based project that helps in managing employee leave requests within an organization. Traditionally, leave applications are handled manually, which often leads to errors, delays, and miscommunication. This system provides a digital solution where employees can easily apply for leave, managers can approve or reject requests, and records are maintained in an organized way.

The main goal of this project is to **simplify and automate the leave process**, ensuring transparency and efficiency. Employees can log in, apply for leaves, and track their history, while admins/managers can monitor and manage these requests effectively.

This project is designed primarily for **academic and learning purposes**, but it has the potential to be extended into a real-world HR solution by integrating features like leave balance calculation, notifications, and advanced reporting. It also serves as a practical example for students and beginners to learn **Django framework, databases, and backend development concepts**.
